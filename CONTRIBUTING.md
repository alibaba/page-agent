   - make sure `eslint`, `auto-format` and `commit-lint` all work

2. **Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start          # Start demo and documentation site
   ```

### Project Structure

This project has **two separate parts**:

- **Core Library** (`src/`) - Pure JavaScript AI agent library
- **Documentation Website** (`pages/`) - React web app for landing page and docs

## 📝 Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc for public APIs

### ✨ AI coder/copilot

- It's **recommended** to heavily rely on AI when maintaining **the webpages and tests**.
- BUT **NOT the core lib!!!** Be very careful if AI touched any code in the core lib.
- Review anything AI wrote before make a commit. You are the author of anything you commit. NOT AI.
- Update the AI instructions.
   - Cursor and Cline: `./.cursor/rules`
   - Github Copilot: `./.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - Claude Code: `./CLAUDE.md`

### Core Library (`src/`)

- **No React dependencies** - Pure JavaScript/TypeScript only
- Use event bus for component communication
- Follow browser-use patterns for DOM operations

### Documentation Site (`pages/`)

- Use React 19 + TypeScript
- Follow hash routing patterns (`useHashLocation`)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Add new docs pages to both router and sidebar

## 🔧 Development Workflows

### Website Development

```bash
npm start                # React development server
```

### Core Lib Development and Testing

- Config your LLM API
- Start a local script
   ```bash
   npm run build:lib:watch    # Auto-rebuild on changes
   ```
- Add a new bookmark enable it on other website
   ```
   javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src=`http://localhost:5173/dist/lib/page-agent.umd.cjs?t=${Math.random()}`;s.onload=()=>console.log(%27PageAgent ready!%27);document.head.appendChild(s);})();
   ```



### Adding Documentation

1. Create `pages/docs/section/page-name/page.tsx`
2. Add route to `pages/router.tsx`
3. Add navigation link to `pages/components/DocsLayout.tsx`
