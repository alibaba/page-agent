Page Agent Ext — AI-Powered Browser Automation

🌟 What is Page Agent Ext?

Page Agent Ext brings AI-powered automation to your browser. Built on the open-source Page Agent framework, it lets you control web pages across multiple tabs using natural language — no scripting required.

🌟 Key Features:

- Natural Language Control — Command your browser in plain language, no code needed
- Cross-Tab Automation — Seamlessly operate across multiple tabs and pages
- Smart HTML Cleaning — Intelligently extracts and simplifies page structure for accurate AI understanding
- Bring Your Own LLM — Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or any compatible API with full data control
- Privacy-First — Zero data collection; all data flows directly to your chosen LLM provider
- Open Source — MIT licensed, built on the Page Agent framework with full transparency

🌟 How It Works & Privacy:

Page Agent Ext performs DOM analysis locally in your browser. When you initiate a task, sanitized page structure is sent to the LLM API you configure. Your data is never collected or stored by us.

- Your API Key — Configure your own LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Data goes directly to your provider
- Test API — A free test endpoint is available for evaluation; we recommend your own key for regular use
